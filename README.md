## Usage
When the user first runs the application they will see the 'About me' page in the application with a summary describing me. In the header of everypage the user will see the developer's name and a very brief description. In the footer of each page the user will see icons for social media including github, facebook and linked in, once clicked the user will be taken to the developer's personal social media accounts. The user will also see a navigation bar at the top of the page, below the header, with links to the 'Portfolio', 'My Resume' and 'Contact Me' page. Once the user has opened the portfolio page the user will see a description of each of the developer's pieces of work and pictures of each project. If the user wishes to view/open the live deployed pieces of work the user should click on the image of the work, they will then be redirected to the corrrect live applications/websites. When the user clicks on the resume page they will see a list of the developer's coding skills. They will also see a dowload resume button at the top of the page, once clicked the user will see that they have downloaded a pdf file containing the developer's resume. Should the user open the contact page, the user will be presented with a form where they can enter their own name, email address and message they would like to send to the developer. Once the user clicks the submit button they will get a message alert telling them that the message was successfully sent.

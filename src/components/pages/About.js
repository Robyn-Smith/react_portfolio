      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      A career in coding is the right choice for me because I enjoy problem solving, creativity 
      and critical thinking. Having recently completed my degree in Integrated Working with Children 
      and Families, including a number of placements and paid employment, I decided to change career 
      path. As a result, I have researched alternative careers and courses, decided to learn Python 
      and quickly gained an interest in coding. I am a self-motivated, high achiever and work well in 
      both team and individual settings. With additional coding skills I believe that I can apply 
      myself to a career in the digital sector.

      I have a strong academic record, my highest achievement being a 1st class BA honours degree. 
      I also have 10 GCSEs at grade C or above (including 3 Bs, 3 As and an A*) and two Cache 
      diplomas, both at grade A.  In learning and working environments I am attentive and 
      enthusiastic. I am keen to excel at coding and utilise my other strengths to bring more 
      than just technical competence into a future role.  Dedication and commitment to learning are 
      key to my success.  I complete all coursework on time and to a high standard and achieve 
      excellent results even in challenging circumstances; the best example being a 1st class 
      honours degree during the Covid-19 pandemic!

      Many of the skills I have learned to date will be beneficial to my future role in the 
      technology sector. These include excellent organisational, leadership and social skills as 
      well as strong mathematical, problem-solving skills. I am familiar and competent with the 
      latest technology; often helping others with technological issues. I am also keen to tap 
      into my creative side, having a flair for art.  

      I am keen to apply my diverse skillset into coding and pursue a career in the tech industry. 
      I am a committed, conscientious and a determined learner. I complete work to a very high 
      standard and achieve excellent results.  I also receive excellent feedback from teachers, 
      tutors and lecturers as well as employers.  Given these attributes, I know that I can achieve 
      an excellent outcome from the bootcamp and embark on a successful career in technology.
